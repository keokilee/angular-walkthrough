angular-walkthrough
===================

Simple Angular starter app for an Ohana.js walkthrough.


Installation
===================

Clone the repo and then run the following commands.

```
> npm install
> gulp
```

The gulpfile also uses live reload, so having the browser extension is highly recommended.
